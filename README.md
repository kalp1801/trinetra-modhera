# Project Trinetra Archive

This repository serves as a public archive of
monitoring infrastructure records
from the Modhera surveillance sector.

Following a major security breach,
multiple observation nodes were isolated
and relocated to external mirror systems
for long-term preservation.

Primary control servers were
permanently decommissioned.

However, legacy system backups
and synchronization records
may still reference active endpoints.

Due to internal classification policies,
direct access to operational infrastructure
has been restricted.
